# Restaurant Analytics Case Study

This is a comprehensive data analysis project where I explore and derive insights from a real-world restaurant dataset.

##Goals
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Explore cuisine, city, country-wise restaurant distributions
- Understand rating trends by price range, delivery, and booking
- Visualize geospatial and categorical features
- Engineer new features for future modeling

##Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Plotly (optional)

##Sections
1. **Data Cleaning** – handle missing values, data types
2. **Descriptive Analysis** – understand cities, cuisines, pricing
3. **Geospatial Mapping** – visualize restaurant locations
4. **Feature Engineering** – create binary & text-based features

##Status
This project focuses on data analytics and feature engineering. Predictive modeling is planned as a future extension.
